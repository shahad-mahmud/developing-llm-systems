# Developing LLM systems

In recent times Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular. These models are trained on large amounts of text data and can be used for a variety of tasks such as text generation, text classification, and text summarization. This repository contains codes and resources to develop different types of LLM systems. 

## How to use this repository

To use the codes in this repository, you need to have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The notebooks are self explanatory and can be run in any order. Furthermore, you have have a look at these [blog posts](https://shahadmahmud.com/categories/#llm) to understand the codes better.
